- GraphDistance nel CSV!
    - GraphDistance wants org.gephi.graph.api.HierarchicalGraph, but I have only a org.gephi.graph.dhns.core.Dhns. How to convert the object to the new type?
        - read gephi sources about DHNS
            - DHNS IS a GraphModel!
                - read sources of HierarchicalGraph (GraphModel -> HierarchicalGraph??)
                    - underlying graph is: org.gephi.graph.dhns.graph.HierarchicalUndirectedGraphImpl -- I may use this to get org.gephi.graph.api.HierarchicalGraph
