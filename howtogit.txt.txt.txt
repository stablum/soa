GET STARTED: DO THIS FIRST!

download GIT! http://git-scm.com/download/win

subscribe to the website. top bar from https://github.com/

when registered, open the ugly git bash (command prompt).
type:
$ git config --global user.email ''myname@mail.com''

type:
$ git config --global user.name ''myusername''

now open the nice gui.
get your copy: from the gui set origin the url: https://github.com/stablum/soa
and to set the target, make in the gui a new directory in your pc

then from the gui, RENAME YOUR BRANCH branch name into something different

DO SOME ACTIONS
---
to push (you did something u want to share with us), use the gui:
commit> rescan
with the mouse, click on the files showing under unstaged changes

commit> stage to commit
the same files should go undr the green tab 'staged changes'

click on commit button: add a message like ''random 1st change from myusername''

click on push:
you have shared your first contribution! congratulations!


-
from the git bash (command).
open the folder above where you stored the code. 
right click > git bash
type on the command of git: git commit -a -m


---
to pull (you want to get other's work. and you want it fresh all the times!)

git pull origin master

if it crash, something is wrong with the dependencies between the online-master and your branch (personal editable copy) of the code.

check for your random 1st change: you should be able to see it by now.
